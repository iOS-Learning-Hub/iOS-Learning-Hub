###### Protocol
# Scene

## What is it?
- A part of an app's user interface with a life cycle managed by the system.
- You create an [App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app) by combining one or more instances that conform to the Scene protocol in the app's body. 
```
struct MyScene: Scene {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MyRootView()
        }
    }
}
```
- A scene acts as a container for a view hierarchy that you want to display to the user. The system decides when and how to present the view hierarchy in the user interface in a way thatâ€™s platform-appropriate and dependent on the current state of the app.
