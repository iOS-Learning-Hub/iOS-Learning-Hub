### What are operators?


#### ðŸŸ° Assignment Operator


#### ðŸ”¢ Arithmetic Operators

Swift supports the four standard *arithmetic operators* for all number types:

**Addition(+)**

```
1 + 2      // equals 3
```

**Subtraction(-)**

```
5 - 2      // equals 3
```

**Multiplication(*)**

```
2 * 3      // equals 6
```

**Division (/)**

```
10.0 / 2.5     // equals 4.0
```
---

#### Remainder Operator

#### Compound Assignment Operators

Swift provides *compound assignment operators* that combine assignment (=) with another operation. 

**Addition Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 1
a += 2
// a is now equal to 3
```

**Subtraction Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 6
a -= 2
// a is now equal to 4
```

**Multiplication Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 3
a *= 7
// a is now equal to 21
```

**Division Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 10
a /= 5
// a is now equal to 2
```

#### Comparison Operators

#### Ternary Conditional Operator

#### Nil-Coalescing Operator

#### Range Operators

**Closed Range Operator**

**Half-Open Range Operator**

**One-Sided Ranges**

#### Logical Operators

**Logical NOT operator**

**Logical AND operator**

**Logical OR operator**
