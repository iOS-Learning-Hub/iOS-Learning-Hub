### 📖 What are Data Types?

Swift provides many fundamental data types, including:

- **Int**: Whole numbers (1, 43, -10)
- **Double**: Decimal numbers (3.14, -0.5, 1999.88)
- **String**: Text ("Hello", "Swift is awesome!")
- **Bool**: True or false values
- **Character**: Single characters ('A', '🥳', '7')

Swift is a **type-safe** language, meaning it prevents you from mixing incompatible types accidentally.
