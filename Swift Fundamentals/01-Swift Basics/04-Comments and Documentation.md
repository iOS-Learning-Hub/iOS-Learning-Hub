## ✍️ Comments

Use comments to include nonexecutable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when your code is compiled

**Single-line comments** begin with two forward-slashes (//)

**Multiline comments** start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk ( /* ) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/)

```

// This is a comment


/* This is also a comment
but is written over multiple lines. */

/* This is the start of the first multiline comment.
    /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */
This is the end of the first multiline comment. */

```
