# Operators

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn how Swift supports operators and let you perform operations like assignment, arithmetic, and comparison.

--- 

## What are operators?
An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values. Swift supports the operators you may already know from languages like C, and improves several capabilities to eliminate common coding errors. 


### ðŸŸ° Assignment Operator


### ðŸ”¢ Arithmetic Operators

Swift supports the four standard *arithmetic operators* for all number types:

**Addition(+)**

```
1 + 2      // equals 3
```

**Subtraction(-)**

```
5 - 2      // equals 3
```

**Multiplication(*)**

```
2 * 3      // equals 6
```

**Division (/)**

```
10.0 / 2.5     // equals 4.0
```

### Remainder Operator

### Compound Assignment Operators

Swift provides *compound assignment operators* that combine assignment (=) with another operation. 

**Addition Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 1
a += 2
// a is now equal to 3
```

**Subtraction Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 6
a -= 2
// a is now equal to 4
```

**Multiplication Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 3
a *= 7
// a is now equal to 21
```

**Division Assignment Operator**
```
var a = 10
a /= 5
// a is now equal to 2
```

### Comparison Operators

### Ternary Conditional Operator

### Nil-Coalescing Operator

### Range Operators

**Closed Range Operator**

**Half-Open Range Operator**

**One-Sided Ranges**

### Logical Operators

**Logical NOT operator**

**Logical AND operator**

**Logical OR operator**
